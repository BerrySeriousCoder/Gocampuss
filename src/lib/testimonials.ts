    review: "Sumit bhaiya helped me a lot during AKTU counseling. I was totally confused about choice filling, but he gave me a proper list according to my rank. Because of him, I got into abesec, which was the best option according to my rank. He also guided me during physical reporting and helped me find a PG near my college."
